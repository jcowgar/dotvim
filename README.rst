Jeremy's Vim Setup
==================

Notes
-----

* I could not make powerline function properly with the ``set rtp+=`` setup
  code so after doing a ``pip install powerline`` I copied the
  ``powerline.vim`` file to my ``plugin/`` directory.
* I could not make sparkup function properly so after installing via Vundle, I
  simply copied ``sparkup.vim`` to my ``ftplugin/`` directory.
